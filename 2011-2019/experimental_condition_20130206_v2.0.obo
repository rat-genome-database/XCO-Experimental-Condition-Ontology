A virus is one of a group of heterogeneous infective agents characterized by their lack of independent metabolism, their inability to replicate outside a host cell, their simple organization and their unique mode of replication. A virus consists of genetic material--either DNA or RNA--surrounded by a protein coat and, in some cases, by a membranous envelope." [Saunders:Saunders_Comprehensive_Veterinary_Dictionary--3rd_Ed]
